# Incident event data analysis
## Installation

No extra libraries needs to be installed as all the libraries used here comes up wwith the Anaconda distribution with Python3.6.

## Project Motivation 

Incident managment has huge oppertunity around ML use case as these get generated from huge event log data. Here I thought to analyze Incident event data to see what hidden patterns will help us to come up with impactful ML use case.

## File Descriptions 

The jupyter notebook is the only code file that has all the code and the csv file used for the analysis is in data folder..

## How To Interact With Your Project 

Fork the repository and contribute on other ideas to analyze for more ML use case around incident managent.
